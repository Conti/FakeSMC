Open source SMC device driver/emulator (FakeSMC) by netkas (http://netkas.org/) with hardware monitoring plugins ported from OpenHardwareMonitor for Windows and hwmon sensors drivers from Linux.

NOTE: FakeSMC & Plugins starting from v915 provides additional sensors information to HWMonitor then running on Macs. Anyway by installing FakeSMC on real Mac you should consider to know what you do and how to recover your system if something will go wrong.
